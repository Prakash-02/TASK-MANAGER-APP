import TaskForm from './TaskForm';
import TaskList from './TaskList';

const App = () => {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

  const addTask = (task) => {
    setTasks([...tasks, task]);
  };

  const removeTask = (index) => {
    setTasks(tasks.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
  };

  const toggleComplete = (index) => {
    const newTasks = [...tasks];
    newTasks[index].completed = !newTasks[index].completed;
    setTasks(newTasks);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Task Manager</h1>
      <TaskForm addTask={addTask} />
      <TaskList tasks={tasks} removeTask={removeTask} toggleComplete={toggleComplete} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
